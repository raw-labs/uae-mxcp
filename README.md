# UAE Business Licenses MCP Project

This project provides a full-stack, enterprise-ready MCP (MXCP) server for querying UAE business license data, with LLM (Claude Desktop) integration, dbt data pipeline, and robust filter/value discovery.

---

## **Quickstart**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd uae-mxcp
```

---

### 2. **Set Up Python Environment**

> **Note:** You need Python 3.8+ and `virtualenv` or `venv`.

```bash
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install mxcp
```

---

### 3. **Prepare the Database with dbt**

**Load raw data using a staging model:**

Instead of using `dbt seed`, this project loads the raw data file (e.g., `data/licenses.csv`) directly in a staging model using DuckDB's `read_csv_auto` function. This approach allows for preprocessing and transformation as part of the model logic.

Example staging model (`models/staging/stg_licenses.sql`):

```sql
select * from read_csv_auto('data/licenses.csv', header=True)
```

You do not need a `seeds/` directory unless you use `dbt seed`. It is safe to omit or rename it if not used.

**Run dbt models** (builds all tables/views):

```bash
dbt run
```

---

### 4. **Start the MXCP Server**

#### **Option 1: Standard (recommended for development)**
```bash
mxcp serve
```

#### **Option 2: Clean Server with Role-Based Access**

The project includes role-based data redaction policies and provides clean stdio output (suitable for LLM integration). Start the server with a specific role:

```bash
# Start as guest user (restricted access)
./start-mcp.sh --role guest

# Start as admin user (full access)
./start-mcp.sh --role admin

# Show all options
./start-mcp.sh --help
```

> **Note:** The `--role` flag is for documentation and demonstration purposes only. The current MXCP server does **not** enforce this flag or perform data redaction based on it. Actual role-based redaction requires a proxy or future MXCP feature.

The following sensitive information is protected for guest users:

1. **Personal Information:**
   - Owner nationality (EN/AR)
   - Owner gender
   - Full address

2. **Business Information:**
   - Trade names (EN/AR)
   - CBLS number
   - Business activity codes and descriptions
   - Parent license numbers

3. **Relationship Information:**
   - Relationship types (EN/AR)
   - Parent license authorities (EN/AR)

4. **Location Information:**
   - Precise coordinates (latitude/longitude)
   - Exact location data

**Restrictions by Tool:**
- **Search Tool:** All sensitive fields are masked
- **Geo Tool:** Sensitive fields and precise locations are masked
- **Aggregate Tool:** Cannot aggregate by sensitive fields
- **Timeseries Tool:** Cannot filter by sensitive fields
- **Categorical Values Tool:** Cannot access sensitive field categories

Admin users have full access to all fields and functionality.

### 5. **Project Structure**

- `prompts/` — LLM prompt YAMLs (e.g., onboarding, guidance)
- `tools/` — MXCP tool YAMLs and SQLs (search, aggregate, timeseries, geo, categorical values, etc.)
- `resources/` — Resource YAMLs and SQLs (e.g., metadata endpoints)
- `models/` — dbt models (including staging models for raw data loading)
- `seeds/` — (optional, not used by default) dbt seed data; you can omit or rename this if not using dbt seed
- `db-prod.duckdb` — Main DuckDB database (generated by dbt)
- `start-mcp.sh` — Clean server startup for LLM integration

---

### 6. **Claude Desktop Integration**

To integrate with Claude Desktop, add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uae": {
      "command": "bash",
      "args": [
        "-c",
        "cd /path/to/uae-mxcp && ./start-mcp.sh --role guest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PATH": "/path/to/uae-mxcp/.env/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin",
        "HOME": "/home/your-username"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** The `--role` flag in the config is for documentation/demo only and is not enforced by the server.

Replace:
- `/path/to/uae-mxcp` with your project path
- `/home/your-username` with your home directory
- Adjust `--role` based on desired access level (`guest` or `admin`)

The server will start with clean stdio output suitable for LLM integration.

### 11. **Requirements**

```
pip install mxcp
```

Only `mxcp` is required to run the MCP server. If you are developing dbt models or using other tools, install them as needed (e.g., `dbt`, `duckdb`).

Data is loaded using a staging model (not `dbt seed`).

**How to load raw data:**

1. Place your raw data file (e.g., `data/licenses.csv`) in a location accessible to DuckDB.
2. Reference it in a staging model (e.g., `models/staging/stg_licenses.sql`).

Example:

```sql
-- models/staging/stg_licenses.sql
select * from read_csv_auto('data/licenses.csv', header=True)
```

You do not need a `seeds/` directory unless you use `dbt seed`. It is safe to omit or rename it if not used.
