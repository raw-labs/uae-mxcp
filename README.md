# UAE Business Licenses - Embedded SQL Tools Demo

This is a **minimal example** demonstrating MXCP's embedded SQL tools functionality. It shows how to go from a CSV file to a queryable system with just a few files and zero tool configuration.

---

## Overview

This ultra-simplified setup demonstrates the **embedded SQL tools** approach where you can query data directly using SQL without creating custom tool definitions. Perfect for rapid prototyping and simple data exploration.

### Key Features

| Feature                  | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Embedded SQL Tools**  | Direct SQL querying via `mxcp query` command - no YAML configuration needed                   |
| **Minimal Setup**       | Single dbt model reading CSV data - 3 core files total                                        |
| **Sample Data**         | 1,000 UAE business license records for fast demos                                             |
| **JSON Output**         | Structured API responses with `--json-output` flag                                            |
| **Real Business Data**  | Actual UAE license data with emirates, business types, and ownership information              |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- dbt and MXCP installed

### Setup (3 steps)

1. **Build the data model**
   ```bash
   dbt run --vars '{"licenses_file": "seeds/licenses_sample.csv"}'
   ```

2. **Test basic query**
   ```bash
   mxcp query "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records FROM licenses"
   ```

3. **Try complex queries**
   ```bash
   mxcp query "SELECT \"Emirate Name En\", COUNT(*) as count FROM licenses GROUP BY \"Emirate Name En\" ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 5" --json-output
   ```

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Queries
```bash
# Count all records
mxcp query "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM licenses"

# Show first few records
mxcp query "SELECT * FROM licenses LIMIT 3"
```

### Business Analysis
```bash
# Licenses by emirate
mxcp query "SELECT \"Emirate Name En\", COUNT(*) as count FROM licenses GROUP BY \"Emirate Name En\" ORDER BY count DESC"

# Business types
mxcp query "SELECT \"BL Type En\", COUNT(*) as count FROM licenses GROUP BY \"BL Type En\" ORDER BY count DESC"

# License status
mxcp query "SELECT \"BL Status EN\", COUNT(*) as count FROM licenses GROUP BY \"BL Status EN\""
```

### JSON Output
Add `--json-output` to any query for structured API responses:
```bash
mxcp query "SELECT \"Emirate Name En\", COUNT(*) as licenses FROM licenses GROUP BY \"Emirate Name En\" LIMIT 3" --json-output
```
