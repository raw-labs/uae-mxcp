# 🚀 Multi-Model Framework Demo Prompts

This document contains user prompts that demonstrate the new multi-model capabilities of the UAE MXCP system. These prompts showcase relationship detection, dynamic embedding, LLM guidance, and the enhanced user experience.

## 🔗 **1. Basic Multi-Model Discovery**

### Prompt: "What tools can help me explore license ownership data?"
**Expected Response**: The LLM should discover and recommend the `find_license_owners` tool, explaining its multi-model capabilities.

**Demonstration**: 
- Tool discovery and recommendation
- Multi-model awareness
- Relationship understanding

---

## 🎯 **2. Dynamic Embedding - Basic Usage**

### Prompt: "Find license owners in Dubai and include their license information"
**Expected Tool Call**:
```yaml
tool: find_license_owners
parameters:
  # (The LLM should figure out how to filter by Dubai)
  embed: ["licenses"]  # Key multi-model feature!
```

**Demonstration**:
- Cross-entity filtering intelligence
- Automatic embed parameter usage
- Lazy loading of related data

---

## 🤖 **3. LLM Autocompletion & Guidance**

### Prompt: "Show me license owners with their license details embedded"
**Expected Behavior**: 
- LLM should automatically suggest `embed: ["licenses"]`
- Should explain what embedding means
- Should show available embed options

**Demonstration**:
- Enum-based autocompletion working
- LLM understanding of embed semantics
- User guidance on multi-model features

---

## 🔍 **4. Relationship-Aware Queries**

### Prompt: "Find all owners of active licenses in Abu Dhabi"
**Expected Intelligence**:
- LLM should understand this requires both owner and license data
- Should use `find_license_owners` with appropriate filters
- Should include `embed: ["licenses"]` to get license status

**Demonstration**:
- Cross-entity query understanding
- Intelligent tool selection
- Relationship-aware filtering

---

## 📊 **5. Complex Multi-Entity Analysis**

### Prompt: "Show me a breakdown of license ownership by nationality, including the license types and statuses"
**Expected Approach**:
- Use `aggregate_license_owners` for nationality breakdown
- Include `embed: ["licenses"]` for license type/status data
- Possibly combine with license aggregation tools

**Demonstration**:
- Complex analytical thinking
- Multi-tool coordination
- Rich embedded data usage

---

## 🔄 **6. Embed Parameter Autocorrection**

### Prompt: "Find license owners and embed the license data"
**User might say**: "embed the license information" or "include license details"
**Expected LLM Behavior**: 
- Should autocorrect to `embed: ["licenses"]` 
- Should explain the correction
- Should use the proper enum value

**Demonstration**:
- Natural language to parameter mapping
- Autocorrection capabilities
- User education about proper syntax

---

## 🎪 **7. Comparison: Before vs After Multi-Model**

### Prompt: "I want to see license owners and their corresponding license details"

**Before Multi-Model** (what user had to do):
1. Call `find_license_owners` to get owners
2. Manually extract license_pk values  
3. Call `find_licenses` multiple times for each license
4. Manually correlate the data

**After Multi-Model** (what LLM can now do):
```yaml
tool: find_license_owners
parameters:
  embed: ["licenses"]
```
- Single call gets everything
- Automatic relationship handling
- Rich embedded data in response

**Demonstration**:
- Dramatic improvement in user experience
- Reduction in API calls
- Simplified workflow

---

## 🌟 **8. Advanced Relationship Scenarios**

### Prompt: "Show me UAE national license owners and their business license details for companies established after 2020"
**Expected Intelligence**:
- Filter owners by nationality: "UAE"
- Embed license data: `embed: ["licenses"]`
- Apply date filter to embedded license data
- Understand cross-entity temporal filtering

**Demonstration**:
- Complex multi-entity filtering
- Temporal relationship queries
- Advanced embedding usage

---

## 🔮 **9. Future Chained Relationships Demo**

### Prompt: "Find license owners with their license details and business activity information"
**Future Capability** (when chained relationships are implemented):
```yaml
tool: find_license_owners  
parameters:
  embed: ["licenses.activities"]  # Chained: owners → licenses → activities
```

**Demonstration**:
- Roadmap for chained relationships (A→B→C)
- Advanced embedding scenarios
- Multi-hop relationship traversal

---

## 💡 **10. LLM Education & Discovery**

### Prompt: "What's the difference between calling find_licenses and find_license_owners with embed?"
**Expected Educational Response**:
- Explain the perspective difference (license-centric vs owner-centric)
- Show when to use each approach
- Demonstrate embed parameter benefits
- Explain relationship directionality

**Demonstration**:
- LLM understanding of data relationships
- User education capabilities
- Contextual guidance

---

## 🧪 **11. Error Handling & Validation**

### Prompt: "Find license owners and embed the owner details"
**Expected Error Handling**:
- LLM should recognize invalid embed value
- Should suggest correct options: `["licenses"]`
- Should explain why "owner" is not valid (circular reference)

**Demonstration**:
- Intelligent error prevention
- Validation and suggestions
- User guidance on proper usage

---

## 🎯 **12. Performance-Aware Usage**

### Prompt: "Get a quick list of license owners without extra details"
**Expected Optimization**:
- Use `find_license_owners` WITHOUT embed parameter
- Explain performance benefits of lazy loading
- Show when embedding is vs isn't needed

**Demonstration**:
- Performance-conscious recommendations
- Lazy loading education
- Optimal query patterns

---

## 📈 **13. Real-World Business Scenarios**

### Prompt: "I need to audit all expired licenses and contact their primary owners"
**Expected Workflow**:
1. Use `find_licenses` with status filter for expired
2. Use `find_license_owners` with `is_primary_owner: true` and `embed: ["licenses"]`
3. Cross-reference to get contact information

**Demonstration**:
- Real business use case
- Multi-tool workflow
- Practical relationship usage

---

## 🌍 **14. Geographic + Ownership Analysis**

### Prompt: "Show me license ownership patterns by emirate, including license types"
**Expected Approach**:
- Use geographic tools with embedding
- Combine `geo_licenses` with ownership data
- Use `embed` parameters for rich analysis

**Demonstration**:
- Geographic relationship awareness
- Cross-entity analytics
- Spatial + ownership intelligence

---

## 🎨 **15. Creative Exploration**

### Prompt: "Help me explore the relationship between license owners and their businesses"
**Expected Creativity**:
- Suggest various analysis approaches
- Show different embedding scenarios
- Propose interesting correlations
- Guide exploratory data analysis

**Demonstration**:
- Creative data exploration
- Relationship discovery
- Analytical thinking
- User inspiration
